[![Travis Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/XCSoar/xcsoar-data-repository/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/XCSoar/xcsoar-data-repository)

This repository describes the data that the File Manager of
[XCSoar](https://xcsoar.org/) is able to download. This data includes
terrain and topography maps, airspace, waypoint and other files like the FlarmNet
database.

## Contributing
Contributions here have to pass:
  * A url availability check
  * A review by another contributer 

If both checks pass, the resulting repository file is automatically generated and deployed to [http://download.xcsoar.org/repository](http://download.xcsoar.org/repository)

If you feel that some important files are missing, please fork this repository
and send a [pull request](https://github.com/XCSoar/xcsoar-data-repository/pulls).
